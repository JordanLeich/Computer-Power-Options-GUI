# Description 
- This is one of my very first GUI applications/programs that allows the user to be given five different options. The user can either shutdown, hibernate, restart, or log out from their computer. The last option is an exit choice to close the GUI application.

# Instructions 
- If you do not have python installed, you can simply download the [Installer](https://github.com/JordanLeich/Computer-Power-Options-GUI/blob/master/Computer%20Power%20Options%20Installer.exe) and then open the program.exe file inside the folder!
